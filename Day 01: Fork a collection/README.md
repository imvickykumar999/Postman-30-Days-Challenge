## Instructions for Day 1: [Fork a collection](https://www.postman.com/vickykumar999/workspace/github/documentation/21969867-73c41579-e581-43aa-81dc-86c19ffee4ad)

1. **Get the challenge:** Fork [the parent collection `Day 01: Fork a collection`](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/30-days-of-postman-for-developers/documentation/1559645-02f21db3-4424-4a4d-8bae-1b1fe1f75987) to your own public workspace.
2. **Read the documentation:** In your fork, select the first folder `Fork a collection`. Expand the context bar on the right to follow the instructions in the collection documentation. If you find it bothersome to navigate between the documentation while working in a different area of Postman, remember that you can open a new tab to keep your place in the documentation, and then switch between tabs.
3. **Submit your solution:** Select the second folder `Submit your solution` and follow the instructions in the documentation to validate your solution.
